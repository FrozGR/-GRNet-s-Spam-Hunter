#GRNet's Spam Hunter (TCL Script for Eggdrop)

Detects public/notice/ctcp and all kinds of channel spam, and filters it with the addition of a "word/phrase exception list" to avoid report/kick or kick&ban entertainment links as youtube.com, dailymotion.com, shoutcast radios and other urls like that, which are permitted on your channel.
